# Grammar Production (Cloze)

This card type is designed to test your ability to actively produce and recall correct Japanese grammar patterns when given context.

## Fields

1. **Sentence**: The full Japanese sentence. Use Anki's cloze deletion format for the grammar pattern (e.g., `今日は{{c1::より}}も暖かい。`).
2. **EnglishMeaning**: The full sentence translation.
3. **GrammarPoint**: The name of the grammar pattern for reference (e.g., `〜より`).
4. **Hint**: A context clue or explanation of the feeling/nuance (e.g., "comparison").
5. **Note**: Additional notes, usage rules, or exceptions for this grammar point.

## How to use

When creating a note, select the **Grammar Production Cloze** note type. 

1. **Sentence**: Wrap the target grammar pattern in `{{c1::...}}`.
   - **Pro Tip**: You can add a short inline hint using `{{c1::answer::hint}}`. This will show `[hint]` in the sentence on the front side.
2. **Hint Field**: Use this for longer context or nuance explanations.

## Goal

The goal is to move beyond recognition and build active usage skills by recalling the correct pattern from the English meaning and hint.
